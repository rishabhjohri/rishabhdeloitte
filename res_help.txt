Additional Tips for Deloitte Upload:

Use bullet points for clear impact.
Put “Cloud” and “Big Data” keywords up-front if applying for engineering/data roles.
Quantify results (e.g., “reduced latency by 30%”).
Highlight certifications directly under “Skills” or a separate “Certifications” section.
Structure projects to emphasize your engineering contributions, not just academic focus.
